Raw sequencing reads were processed using ENCODE ATAC-seq pipeline v1.1.7. Trimmed adaptor sequences were ‘R1: CTGTCTCTTATACACATCT; R2: CTGTCTCTTATACACATCT’ for profiles in Yee Mon et al, 2021 and Smith et al, 2018. Reads were mapped to the mouse genome (mm10). Paired-end mode was enabled, and peak calling was performed using MACS2 with ‘-f BEDPE’. Irreproducibility Discovery Rate (IDR) analysis was enabled for cross-validation to compare replicates. Reads were counted on peaks merged from all samples with featureCounts (‘-F SAF -s 0 -Q 38’ for profiles in Smith et al, 2018 and ‘-p -F SAF -s 0 -Q 38’ for the rest of profiles).
